Calm Waters: Navigating Conflict VR

Project Overview

Calm Waters: Navigating Conflict VR is an immersive virtual reality experience designed to teach conflict resolution skills through interactive scenarios. Set in a realistic environment, the player is placed in the middle of a tense conversation between two characters, Remy and Kate, who are struggling to work together on a group project. The player's goal is to de-escalate the situation by making thoughtful dialogue choices at critical points in the conversation.

Features
Interactive Dialogue System: Players are presented with three dialogue choices at five key points during the conversation: neutral, calm, and escalating responses. The choices made by the player directly impact the outcome of the scenario.
Multiple Endings: The scenario can conclude in one of three ways:
A successful de-escalation where Remy and Kate resolve their differences.
A neutral outcome where the conflict remains unresolved but does not worsen.
A failed de-escalation where the situation escalates into an altercation.
Realistic VR Environment: The scenario takes place in a carefully designed virtual school hallway, complete with ambient sounds and environmental details to enhance immersion.
Feedback System: After the scenario concludes, the player receives feedback based on their decisions, providing insights into how their choices impacted the outcome and what could be improved.
